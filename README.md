SecureApp is a .NET-based licensing solution for developers needing a secure, efficient, and reliable solution. This project brings everything you need to start. No bloated, useless features you will never use, just the correct amount of features you need.

SecureApp's sockets system is based off [SyncIO](https://github.com/BahNahNah/SyncIO). It was originally based off [eSock](https://gist.github.com/BahNahNah/5f66e2c1d5c32fc25f93), but the developer combined two amazing projects into one making it easier for SecureApp.

## Requirements
* Microsoft Windows
* .NET Framework 4.5

**Note: SecureApp will be ported to .NET Core to enable support for MacOS and Linux.**
